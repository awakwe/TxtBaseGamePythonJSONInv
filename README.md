Welcome to this course on coding a text-based adventure game in Python using JSON for inventory management. Throughout this course, you will learn the fundamentals of Python programming and JSON while building an interactive game.
### About Me

Hello, and welcome to this course on creating a text-based adventure game using Python and JSON inventory! My name is Tony, and I'll be your instructor throughout this exciting journey. I'm a passionate engineer and educator with years of experience in the field.

I've always been intrigued by the world of game development, and text-based adventure games hold a special place in my heart. Through this course, I hope to share my enthusiasm for programming and game design with you, while equipping you with valuable skills that you can apply to various programming projects.

In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with new programming languages, exploring open-source projects, and learning about the latest advancements in technology. I believe that education is a lifelong journey, and I'm excited to be a part of your learning experience.

I can't wait to get started on this adventure with you. Let's dive into the world of Python programming and create an engaging text-based adventure game together!

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Python Programming

### Variables and Data Types

- Variables: Storing data for later use
- Data Types: int, float, str, bool, list, dict
Variables and Data Types
========================

In this section, we'll discuss variables and data types in Python, which are essential building blocks for any program. Understanding these concepts is crucial for creating a text-based adventure game or any other programming project.

Variables
---------

Variables are used to store data in your program. They can be thought of as containers that hold information that can be accessed and manipulated throughout your code. To create a variable, you simply assign a value to a name using the equal sign `=`.

Example:

python

```python
name = "John"
age = 25
```

In this example, we create two variables: `name`, which stores the string "John" and `age`, which stores the integer 25.

Data Types
----------

Python has several built-in data types that you'll use frequently when programming. Here are some of the most common ones:

### Strings

Strings are sequences of characters, such as words or sentences. They are enclosed in either single or double quotes.

Example:

python

```python
greeting = "Hello, world!"
```

### Integers

Integers are whole numbers, both positive and negative.

Example:

python

```python
score = 42
```

### Floats

Floats, or floating-point numbers, are numbers with a decimal point.

Example:

python

```python
pi = 3.14159
```

### Lists

Lists are ordered collections of items. They can store items of any data type, and they are mutable, meaning you can change their contents.

Example:

python

```python
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
```

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They are useful for storing data that can be easily accessed using keys.

Example:

python

```python
player_info = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 25,
    "score": 42
}
```

By understanding variables and data types in Python, you'll be well-prepared to create complex programs and games, such as the text-based adventure game we'll be building in this course.

### Loops

- For Loops: Iterating over a sequence
- While Loops: Iterating based on a condition

### Functions

- Defining functions: Using `def` keyword
- Calling functions: Executing a function

## Lesson 2: JSON Inventory

### JSON Data Structures

- Objects: Enclosed by `{ }`
- Arrays: Enclosed by `[ ]`
- Properties: Separated by colons

### JSON Advantages

- Versatile: Wide range of information
- Easy to use: Human-readable
- Industry standard: Widely accepted

### JSON Limitations

- Large data management: Difficult to manage as data increases
- Not designed to be a database

## Lesson 3: Skeleton Code

### Basic Code Structure

- Moving between rooms
- Collecting items

### Adding Features

- Different paths
- New items
- Obstacles

## Lesson 4: Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Handling Errors and Exceptions

- Syntax Errors
- ZeroDivisionError
- ValueError

### Example: User Input & Exceptions

- `input` function for user input
- Exception handling with `try` and `except`

## Lesson 5: Project & Conclusion

### Project Submission

- Post completed project in Project Gallery

### Key Takeaways

- Importance of data structures
- Using JSON for inventory management
- Python programming basics

### Final Message

- Thank you for joining the course
- Continue to explore new programming skills
- Happy coding!
