I've always been intrigued by the world of game development, and text-based adventure games hold a special place in my heart. Through this course, I hope to share my enthusiasm for programming and game design with you, while equipping you with valuable skills that you can apply to various programming projects.

In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with new programming languages, exploring open-source projects, and learning about the latest advancements in technology. I believe that education is a lifelong journey, and I'm excited to be a part of your learning experience.

I can't wait to get started on this adventure with you. Let's dive into the world of Python programming and create an engaging text-based adventure game together!

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Python Programming

### Variables and Data Types

- Variables: Storing data for later use
- Data Types: int, float, str, bool, list, dict

### Loops

- For Loops: Iterating over a sequence
- While Loops: Iterating based on a condition

### Functions

- Defining functions: Using `def` keyword
- Calling functions: Executing a function

## Lesson 2: JSON Inventory

### JSON Data Structures

- Objects: Enclosed by `{ }`
- Arrays: Enclosed by `[ ]`
- Properties: Separated by colons

### JSON Advantages

- Versatile: Wide range of information
- Easy to use: Human-readable
- Industry standard: Widely accepted

### JSON Limitations

- Large data management: Difficult to manage as data increases
- Not designed to be a database

## Lesson 3: Skeleton Code

### Basic Code Structure

- Moving between rooms
- Collecting items

### Adding Features

- Different paths
- New items
- Obstacles

## Lesson 4: Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Handling Errors and Exceptions

- Syntax Errors
- ZeroDivisionError
- ValueError

### Example: User Input & Exceptions

- `input` function for user input
- Exception handling with `try` and `except`

## Lesson 5: Project & Conclusion

### Project Submission

- Post completed project in Project Gallery
